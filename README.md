# [INAZE-INVISISBLE MAZE] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Ex-ecution Failed ]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ann Saniya - [SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERNG AND TECHNOLOGY]

### [Project description]
Invisible Maze is an interactive puzzle game where players navigate through a hidden maze without seeing the walls, relying only on memory, logic, and subtle cues to reach the goal. It challenges problem-solving skills while adding an element of surprise and suspense.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of mazes where you can actually see the walls. Life is too easy when you know where you‚Äôre going! We‚Äôre solving the nonexistent crisis of ‚Äúvisible maze fatigue‚Äù by removing the walls entirely‚Ä¶ but still making you crash into them.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We introduce the *Invisible Maze* ‚Äî a thrilling challenge where walls are completely hidden, and players must navigate using pure guesswork, memory, and frustration. It‚Äôs the perfect fix for anyone who thought regular mazes were ‚Äútoo fair.‚Äù
